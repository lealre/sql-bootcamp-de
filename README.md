# SQL Bootcamp for Data Engineering and Analytics

In this repository, I applied the concepts taught in the [Data Engineering SQL Bootcamp](https://github.com/lvgalvao/data-engineering-roadmap/tree/main/Bootcamp%20-%20SQL%20e%20Analytics) by [Luciano Galv√£o](https://github.com/lvgalvao).

We utilized PostgreSQL as our database system and PGAdmin as the client tool for interaction. 

Each folder corresponds to a class where I practiced the concepts taught in PGAdmin and included some notes.

The database used is the [Northwind database for Postgres](https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql).
